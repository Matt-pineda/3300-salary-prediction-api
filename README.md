# 3300 - Salary Prediction Model API

ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction API
This repository contains a machine learning-powered API that predicts salaries based on user-input features such as education, experience, and job-related data. Built as part of a personal project to deepen my skills in Python, scikit-learn, and API deployment, this tool demonstrates how data analytics and web services can be combined to deliver practical, real-time insights.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The goal of this project was to build a simple yet functional API capable of returning salary predictions based on structured input data. The API was trained on a cleaned dataset of job postings and salary information, using regression models to estimate outcomes.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python â€“ Core programming language

Flask â€“ Lightweight web framework for building the API

scikit-learn â€“ Used for model training and prediction

Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data processing and manipulation

Joblib â€“ For saving and loading the trained model

GitHub + Git â€“ Version control and repository hosting
